Overview
===============

This page lists known midwest tow parks and may eventually list airfields that allow towing. 

Wisconsin Hang Gliding Club
===============================

Danny and Karen run a great tow op out of Whitewater, WI. It's as much a club as a business, so expect a laid back atmosphere and nice comraderie. 

They are usually open 7 days a week. They move the operation to Arizona for the winter. 

Amenities: 

* Two long, grassy strips w/ launches in 4 directions
* Small training hill 
* Hanger, small store, carts at the ready
* Camping, showers, fire pit, picnic tables
* Close to town

Hang Glide Chicago
===============================

I haven't been there yet, so I can only post their website link. You find details at: https://hangglidechicago.com/. 

They normally run a weekend-only show. 

Airfields
============

* Thompsonville, Michigan: Was once a tow site. Probably still an option. 
* Other Northern Michigan strips: There are many.
