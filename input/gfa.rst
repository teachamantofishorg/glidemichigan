Notes
===========

Early feb: CC won't provide any public roster, by bylaws, or voting history for GFA. 

2/13: Talked with Martin (USHPA pres): GFA is not a club and has no insurance for the last two years. 

2/15: Talked with Craig Carlson: No insurance. Wants to get ins on adjacent properties but that is causing RRRG to ask for detailed risk assessments and they are balking. 32 landowners/shareholders. 

2/15: anon: GFA has 40k in the bank in 2020. No issue with money. 



USHPA Greenpoint club factoids
======================================

Greenpoint Flyers Association (GFA) is an USHPA chapter. 

GFA membership requires buying a share of the GFA corporation. 

A person or family can only hold one share. 

Cost? Varies by the seller. 

How many total shares are there? Unknown. 

GFA supposedly has bylaws and a roster that must be filed with USHPA, but only shareholders can see those docs. 

GFA is run by a board of directors. Only shareholders can participate in elections.  

Website? No. 

Open forum or Facebook page? No. Invite only. They've been known to delete posts they don't like, so free speech does not apply. 

Paying flight dues does not make you a member. Your fee only entitles you to fly Greenpoint. It does not entitle you to vote or participate in meetings.
